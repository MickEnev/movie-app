# Movie app

This is my third app in a series of apps I am making to leran React. This app allows users to fetch popular movies and save them to a list of favorites.

# Roadmap

As I continue to learn React I plan on making a similar app but for TV shows. When I improve my skills I also plan on returning to this one to make improvements such as pages for each movie and things of that nature.
